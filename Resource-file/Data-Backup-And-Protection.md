##### DATA BACKUP AND DATA RECOVERY

### Definition Data Backup.

+ Data backup is the practice of copying data from a primary to a secondary location, to protect it in case of a disaster, accident or malicious action. Data is the lifeblood of modern organizations, and losing data can cause massive damage and disrupt business operations. This is why backing up your data is critical for all businesses, large and small.

### Importance of data backup in preventing data loss

+ **Human error:** accidental deletions, overwriting of files, or format errors
+ **Hardware failures:** physical damage or wear and tear leading to data inaccessibility
+ **Cybersecurity threats:** ransomware, malware, or other forms of attacks that compromise data integrity
+ **Natural disasters:** floods, fires, or other catastrophes that destroy physical hardware

### Backup Types

- There are several types of backup methods, each suited for different needs and circumstances:

1.  **Full Backup**: A complete copy of all data, typically requiring substantial time and storage space but providing a comprehensive snapshot of data at that moment.
   
2.  **Incremental Backup**: Only saves changes made since the last backup (full or incremental). It's quicker and requires less storage, but restoration may take longer since multiple backups are needed.

3.  **Differential Backup**: Backs up all changes since the last full backup. It requires more storage than incremental backups but is faster to restore as only two files are needed: the last full backup and the latest differential backup.

4.  **Mirror Backup**: An exact replica of data in real time, ensuring the backup is always up to date. However, this method can also mirror deletions or accidental changes, which may pose a risk.

5.  **Cloud Backup**: Data is stored on a remote cloud server, providing off-site security and flexibility for accessing backups from any location with internet access.
