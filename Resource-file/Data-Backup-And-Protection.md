DATA BACKUP AND DATA PROTECTION

  
  ---

  ### Definition Data Backup.

+ Data backup is the practice of copying data from a primary to a secondary location, to protect it in case of a disaster, accident or malicious action. Data is the lifeblood of modern organizations, and losing data can cause massive damage and disrupt business operations. This is why backing up your data is critical for all businesses, large and small.

### Importance of data backup in preventing data loss

+ **Human error:** 

  - accidental deletions, overwriting of files, or format errors
+ **Hardware failures:** 

  - physical damage or wear and tear leading to data inaccessibility
+ **Cybersecurity threats:** 

  - ransomware, malware, or other forms of attacks that compromise data integrity
+ **Natural disasters:** 

  - floods, fires, or other catastrophes that destroy physical hardware

### Backup Types

  - There are several types of backup methods, each suited for different needs and circumstances:

1.  **Full Backup**:

    - A complete copy of all data, typically requiring substantial time and storage space but providing a comprehensive snapshot of data at that moment.
   
3.  **Incremental Backup**:

    - Only saves changes made since the last backup (full or incremental). It's quicker and requires less storage, but restoration may take longer since multiple backups are needed.

5.  **Differential Backup**: 

    - Backs up all changes since the last full backup. It requires more storage than incremental backups but is faster to restore as only two files are needed: the last full backup and the latest differential backup.

6.  **Mirror Backup**: 

    - An exact replica of data in real time, ensuring the backup is always up to date. However, this method can also mirror deletions or accidental changes, which may pose a risk.

7.  **Cloud Backup**: 

   - Data is stored on a remote cloud server, providing off-site security and flexibility for accessing backups from any location with internet access.

### Considerations for Data Backup.

## Speed
The backup speed is one of the most important factors you should consider for your data backup. When you first add an appliance to a system, the first complete backup usually takes some time. But after the first backup is complete, the subsequent updates should take less time. If you notice a network slowdown for your end-users due to a slow backup, then your IT may have to suspend backups, thereby affecting your data backup plan.

## Flexibility
The flexibility of your data backup strategy or plan is another factor that you should consider. You want to back up all your data, but this may not be the same for recovery. Recovery must scale from restoring a single file to restoring a whole server.

## Schedule
Your data backups must be automated. They must also run on a schedule without relying on anyone to execute them manually. It would be best if you designed your data backup plans so that they will run frequently and will also capture changes in data and data that rarely change. They should also be scheduled around the needs of your production workflow.

The schedule of your data backup should target the needs of each system, i.e. it must be unique to each system.

### Summary Table

| Frequency    | Storage Options      | 3-2-1 Rule              | Security Measures              |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Daily**    | Cloud, NAS           | Offsite copy in cloud   | Encryption, limited access     |
| **Weekly**   | External drives, NAS | Mix of on-site and off-site | Access control, regular audits |
| **Monthly**  | NAS, External drives, Cloud | External drive offsite | Backup encryption, regular testing |

## Reliability

You must ensure that your data backup strategy is reliable. Once you design the plan, it is important to implement it on an infrastructure you trust. When you ensure that you use the best practices with high-quality, coupled with reliable storage hardware and software solutions, you can be assured that the data you backed up will be recovered whenever you need it.

## Scalability
As time goes on, your data will grow, and the same will also apply to your backup needs. The process through which you backup your data must be buoyant enough to handle the growing volumes of your new data. The process must ensure that your new servers, applications, and data are adequately catered for in your backups.

## Security
You should have access to your data whenever you need it, but not by anyone. Ensure your data backups are safe from any infringement, as this is vital to your businessâ€™s security.
